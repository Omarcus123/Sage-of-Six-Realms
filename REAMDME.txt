This project is a fan-made web application built to teach beginners how to get started with Mortal Kombat 1 (MK1). It recreates elements of the character select screen, kameo assist system, and gameplay guides to give new players a familiar and engaging learning environment.

The goal of this project is to make the learning curve of MK1 less intimidating by providing:

A clean, interactive character roster styled like the in-game select screen.

A Kameo Fighter grid with hover effects that visually pop.

Guides, tutorials, and embedded video links presented in a fighting-game inspired layout.

This website serves as a central educational hub for new players, bridging the gap between raw game mechanics and practical application.

🎯 Why This Project is Important

Mortal Kombat has always been a franchise with deep mechanics and complex systems. For beginners, the sheer number of characters, Kameos, and combos can feel overwhelming.

This project is important because it:

Makes information more accessible by presenting it in a visual, interactive way.

Recreates the familiar MK1 interface, so players can learn in an environment they instantly recognize.

Encourages exploration — new players can hover, click, and learn without walls of text.

Serves as a portfolio project, demonstrating front-end development skills and game-inspired UI/UX design.

By merging design with gameplay education, this project shows how fan communities can make competitive games friendlier and more welcoming.

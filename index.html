  <p>Yooo! My name is <strong>Omarcus "PureFGC" Swims Jr.</strong> I'm a passionate fighting game enthusiast, with a particular love for <em>Mortal Kombat</em> at the moment. My goal is to create a hub for players like myself who want to dive deep into character mechanics, frame data, and strategies.</p>

  <p>I graduated with a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, which allows me to combine my love for gaming with my technical skills to build this website. The inspiration for this project came from the player <strong>RedRaptor</strong> and their <em>Kombat Akademdy</em> website, which set a standard for fighting game resources.</p>

  <p>Currently, this site provides detailed information on character frame data and how to get started playing mortal kombat 1 with a little bit of naruto embedded into it. In the future, I plan to expand it with combo guides, more in depth character guides, and other tools to help both newcomers and seasoned players improve their game. My hope is to create a community where players can learn, share, and level up together.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the site as much as I enjoy building it!</p>
